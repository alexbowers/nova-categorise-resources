# Deprecated

This is now covered in Nova 1.0.18+ so does not need a package for it:

```php
public static $group = 'name'; // you may also use a public static method of the same name
```

You may continue to use this package if you want to be able to collapse the groups, however I'd recommend going with the core features of Nova.

# Group and categorise your nova resources

A nova resource can be given a category name.

If a category name is provided, then that will act as a label.

The label will be standardised, so any changes in capitalisation will be removed
and it will be converted into Title case.

For example:

"Customers Information", "customers information" and "cUStoMERs INFORMATION"

all become "Customers Information"

If the category is left empty, then all empty resources will get grouped together.

If there is only one category, it will not be collapsable, but will instead have a label above it all

if there is only one category, and it is empty, then it will act as Nova does by default.
